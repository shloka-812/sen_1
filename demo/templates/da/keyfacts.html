<h2><u><i>Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)</i></u></h2> <a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever(EHF) is one of the viral haemorrhagic fevers which affects a person's blood system<br>
It is a severe, often fatal illness in humans and non human primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees)<br>
•	It is caused by infection with virus which  is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population.<br>
•	EVD is fatal in, upto- 90% of infected cases.<br>
•	EVD outbreaks(sudden occurrence of disease) are known to occur primarily in villages of  Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests.<br>
•	The largest outbreak is the ongoing 2014 West Africa Ebola Outbreak, which has affected Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. As of August 2014, more than 1,750 cases have been suspected. <br>
•	Severely infected patients require intensive supportive care. No specific treatment or vaccine is available for this disease.<br>
<h3>History</h3>
EVD first originated in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The disease typically occurs in outbreaks in tropical regions of Sub Saharan Africa. Fewer than 1000 people have been infected every year from 1976 till 2013. Ebola virus was first detected in 1976 during outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Zaire and Sudan. The name of the disease originates from one of those first recorded outbreaks in 1976 in  Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire), which is situated on the Ebola River.
<h3>Symptoms of Ebola Virus Disease</h3>
1.	Fever<br>
2.	Headache<br>
3.	Weakness<br>
4.	Joint and muscle pain<br>
5.	Diarrhoea<br>
6.	Vomiting<br>
7.	Pain in stomach<br>
8.	Loss of appetite<br>
<br>
This disease further progresses to bleeding phase which causes external bleeding from eyes, nose ears as well as bleeding inside the body.
Symptoms may appear from 2 to 21 days after exposure to virus, though 8-10 days is most common period after exposure to Ebola virus.

<h3>Cause</h3>
EVD is caused by four of five viruses in the genus Ebola virus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The four disease-causing viruses in humans are as follows:<br>
1.	Bundibugyo Ebola virus (BDBV)<br>
2.	Zaire Ebola virus/Ebola virus (EBOV)<br>
3.	Sudan Ebola virus (SUDV)<br>
4.	Taï Forest Ebola virus (TAFV)<br><br>
BDBV, EBOV, SUDV are most dangerous viruses as well responsible for causing large number of outbreaks in Africa.
The fifth virus called Reston Ebola virus (RESTV) is known to cause disease in non human primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees) 
 
<h3>Transmission</h3>
 
A. Primary Source of Infection:-  The virus is transmitted from animals to humans. The virus is zoonotic (animal-borne) with bats being the most likely reservoir of infection.<br>
B. Secondary Source of Infection:-  The virus can be transmitted from human-to-human through-<br>
<ul><li>Direct contact with  the body fluids such as blood, sweat, saliva, semen or other body discharges of an infected person.</li>
<li>Exposure to objects like needles that have been contaminated with infected person.</li>
<li>The dead body of the infected person can also be a source of infection.</li></ul>
Facts about Transmission-<br>
1.  Ebola can't be transmitted through air.<br>
2.	It can't be transmitted through water.<br>
3.	It can't be transmitted through food.<br>
This clearly states that it is not a food-borne , water- borne and an air-borne disease.
 
<h3>Risk of Exposure</h3>

During the outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are-<br>
1. Health workers.<br>
2. Family and others who are in close contact with of infected individuals.<br>
3. Mourners who come in direct contact with the bodies of the deceased in burial ceremonies.<br>
4. Travellers who visit disease prone areas.<br>
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
It is difficult to diagnose the disease in early stages of infection as the early symptoms are non specific to Ebola virus infection. However, it can be diagnosed through several lab tests such as-<br>
1.	Antibody-capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)<br>
2.	Antigen detection tests<br>
3.	Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR)<br>
4.	Virus isolation by cell culture<br>
5.	Electron microscopy<br>



<h3>Prevention</h3>
The primary preventive measures comprises of isolation   and barrier nursing techniques. Isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick.
Quarantine, a state of enforced isolation, is effective in decreasing the spread of disease and illnessespecially in the case of communicable diseases .   The movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease is restricted to come in contact with those who are healthy. Generally, the duration of quarantine period is the length of disease's incubation period (period between the infection and appearance of symptoms) which is 2-21 days in case of Ebola virus  disease. 
Barrier nursing techniques include:<br>
1.	Wearing  protective clothing (such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles).<br>
2.	Use of infection-control measures (such as complete equipment sterilization and routine use of disinfectant).<br>
3.	Fumigation of   environment and disinfection of   surroundings. The virus cannot survive disinfectants, heat, sunlight, detergents and soaps.<br>
4.	Dead bodies can transmit Ebola. Don't touch them without a protective gear or better avoid them altogether.<br>
5.	Wash your hands with soap or use sanitizer.<br>

<h2><u><i>Chikungunya Fever</i></u></h2> 	<a href="#top">Go back to top</a>
Chikungunya fever is a debilitating, but non-fatal, viral illness. It is spread by the bite of infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Aedes mosquito breeds in clean water collections. The water containers, tanks, discarded material such as buckets, utensils, tyres, flower-pots etc. are the breeding sites for these mosquitoes. The peak biting times of the Aedes aegypti mosquito are early morning or late evening. Chikungunya fever is caused by a virus of genus alphavirus in the family of togaviridae.  It is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g. joint swelling), laboratory testing and the possibility of exposure to infected mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment for Chikungunya fever. The treatment is mainly supportive to ease the symptoms.
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
It is generally characterized by abrupt onset of fever, chills which is accompanied by joint pain. Other symptoms include:<br>
1.	Muscle pain<br>
2.	Fatigue and Nausea<br>
3.	Headache<br>
4.	Rash<br>
5.	The joint pain is often very debilitating, but usually ends within a few days or weeks.<br>
<h3>Causes</h3>
Chikungunya virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person infected with Chikungunya virus. The incubation period (time from infection to illness) can be 2-12 days, but is usually 3-7 days. “Silent” Chikungunya virus infections (infections without illness) do occur, though rarely.

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
The clinical appearance of both chikungunya and dengue are similar. Therefore laboratory confirmation is important especially in areas where dengue is present. Enzyme-Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) may confirm the presence of IgM and IgG anti-Chikungunya antibodies.
Various reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) methods are also available but are of variable sensitivity. RT–PCR products from clinical samples may also be used for genotyping of the virus, allowing comparisons with virus samples from various geographical sources.

<h3>Prevention</h3>
There is neither chikungunya virus vaccine nor drugs are available to cure the infection. Prevention from mosquito bites is the key. Eliminating mosquito breeding sites is another key prevention measure.
Prevention is similar to those for other viral diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue:<br>
1.	Use insect repellent containing DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin. Always follow the directions on the package.<br>
2.	Wear long sleeves and pants (ideally treat clothes with permethrin or another repellent).<br>
3.	Have secure screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.<br>
4.	Additionally, a person with chikungunya fever should limit his exposure to mosquito bites to avoid further spreading the infection. The person should use repellents when outdoors exposed to mosquito bites or stay indoors in areas with screens or under a mosquito net.<br>

<h2><u><i>Cholera</i></u></h2> 	<a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

Cholera is an intestinal infection which is caused when a person consumes contaminated food or water. It is generally caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from one day to five days. After contamination, bacteria produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients.
The cholera bacteria are generally seen in water or food sources, that have been contaminated by faeces from a person infected with cholera. Cholera is usually seen in places with inadequate water treatment, poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene.
The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in salty rivers and coastal waters.
<h3>Symptoms </h3>
Cholera infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. 
 
Infected persons with severe disease  will have:<br>
1.	Profuse watery diarrhea<br>
2.	Vomiting<br>
3.	Leg cramps.<br><br>      
In people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. If not treated it can lead to death within hours.

<h3>Causes</h3>

Cholera is a diarrheal illness caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. This species is not common to humans, and its presence in the human digestive system is not part of the natural life cycle of the bacteria. 
A person can get infected by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium. In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the faeces of an infected person that contaminates water and/or food. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another therefore, casual contact with an infected person is not a risk for becoming ill.
Diagnosis
Laboratory tests include stool gram stain (gram negative rods) culture, dark field microscopy or stool PCR. One must begin treatment even before diagnostic work-up.
Stool sample or a rectal swab is taken and is then send to a laboratory for the cholera bacterium.<br>
Cholera cots: These are cots with openings to allow fecal output into a bucket, are used to measure volumes of stool loss and fluid replacement needs. 
<h3>Prevention</h3>

To prevent cholera:<br>
1.	Drink safe and clean water<br>
2.	Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water<br>
3.	Proper hygiene and sanitation<br>
4.	Cook food welland cover it properly<br><br>
Now a days, there are two oral cholera vaccines available, Dukoral (manufactured by SBL Vaccines) which is World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified and licensed in over 60 countries, and ShanChol (manufactured by Shantha Biotec in India), which is licensed in India and is pending WHO prequalification. Because the vaccine is a two dose vaccine, multiple weeks can elapse before persons receiving the vaccine are protected.
Therefore, vaccination should not replace standard prevention and control measures.

<h2><u><i>Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF)</u></i></h2><a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease caused by tick-borne virus (Nairovirus). It is a zoonotic (could be transmitted from animals to humans) vector-borne disease. CCHF causes severe illness in humans and has a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.
The disease was first described in the Crimea (former USSR) in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo and linkage of the both place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.
The disease is widespread in many countries in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia with sporadic outbreaks recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey.
In India the first confirmed case of CCHF was reported during a nosocomial (Infections caught in hospitals) outbreak in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in January 2011.Subsquently outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012–2015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer). A CCHF case was also reported from Uttar Pradesh state. Pakistan reports 50-60 cases annually.
CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential (biological capacity of a pathogen to cause disease in a particular environment), its high case fatality ratio (10-40%), its potential for nosocomial (hospital acquired infection) outbreaks and the difficulties in its treatment and prevention.
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).
There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).
Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena such as melaena (bleeding from the upper bowel, passed as altered blood in the faeces), haematuria (blood in the urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds) and bleeding from the gums.
There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.
The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness.
<h3>Causes</h3>
CCHF is caused by virus belongs to family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. Since it is enveloped virus, it can be readily inactivated. CCHF virus is stable for up to 10 days in blood kept at 400 C.
Vector (living organisms that can transmit infectious diseases between humans or from animals to humans) - The common vector of CCHF is the member of Hyalomma genus, the family Ixodidae. These are hard ticks and suck blood from animals and humans. Both male and female ticks can act as a vector for disease transmission.
CCHF virus may infect a wide range of wild animals and domestic ruminant animals such as hares, rats, camel, cattle, sheep and goats.<br>
Environmental factors: Ecological changes, poverty, social instability, poor health services, and absence of standard infection control practices have contributed to increased transmission of the CCHF virus.
<h3>Mode of transmission    </h3>
Animal to human transmission-CCHF virus may be transmitted to human either by bite of hard tick or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.<br>
Human to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.<br>
Incubation periods-Incubation period depends on the mode of transmission of disease. It is usually one to three days when infected with tick bite with maximum nine days.
The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.
CCHF virus is highly infectious in the hospital settings. Nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections are common after exposure to blood and secretions of infected persons.
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
There are no rapid diagnostic tests. 
Diagnosis of suspected CCHF is performed in specially-equipped, high bio-safety level laboratories.
IgG and IgM antibodies detection in serum by enzyme-linked immunoassay (the "ELISA" or "EIA" methods) from about day six of illness. IgM remains detectable for up to four months, and IgG levels decline but remain detectable for up to five years.
Virus detection in blood or tissue samples-Patients with fatal disease do not usually develop a measurable antibody response and in these individuals, as well as in patients in the first few days of illness, diagnosis is achieved by virus detection in blood or tissue samples. The virus may be isolated from blood or tissue specimens in the first five days of illness, and grown in cell culture. Viral antigens may sometimes be shown in tissue samples using immunofluorescence or EIA. 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Real-Time PCR, a molecular method for detecting the viral genome, has been successfully applied in diagnosis.

<h3>Preventions</h3>
There is no safe and effective vaccine currently available for human use. CCHF being a zoonotic vector-borne disease multi-sectoral integrated approach involving medical, veterinary and entomology specialties is the key to prevention and control of outbreaks. Infection in people can be reduced by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.
Public health advice should focus on following aspects:<br>
 1) Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:
<ul><li>wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers)</li>
<li>wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes</li>
<li>use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing</li>
<li>use approved repellent on the skin and clothing</li>
<li>regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely</li>
<li>seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns</li>
<li>avoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.</li></ul><br>
2) Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission:
<ul><li>Wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home</li>
<li>Separate or restrict movements of animals(quarantine) before they enter slaughter houses or routinely treat animals with pesticides two weeks prior to slaughter</li></ul><br>
3) Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community:
<ul><li>avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people</li>
<li>wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people</li>
<li>wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people</li></ul>
Controlling infection in health-care settings:
Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices.
Samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.
Recommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever.

<h2><u><i>Meningitis</u></i> </h2><a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

Meningitis  is a disease caused by the inflammation of thin lining covering the brain and spinal cord known as meninges. The infection of the fluids surrounding the brain and spinal cord leads to inflammation of meninges. The severity of illness and treatment of meningitis differ depending on the cause. So, its important to know the specific cause of meningitis.

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

The most common symptom of meningitis is severe headache , followed by nuchal rigidity (the inability to  flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone and stiffness).<br>
 
Early symptoms:<br>
1.	Fever<br>
2.	Severe headache<br>
3.	Nausea and vomiting<br>
4.	Pain in the muscles, joints or limbs, such as in the legs or hands<br>
5.	Unusually cold hands and feet, or shivering<br>
6.	Pale or blotchy skin and blue lips<br><br>
Later symptoms:<br>
1.	Drowsiness<br>
2.	Confusion<br>
3.	Seizures or fits<br>
4.	Being unable to tolerate bright light (photophobia) – this is less common in young children<br>
5.	A stiff neck – also less common in young children<br>
6.	A rapid breathing rate<br>

<h3>Causes</h3>
Meningitis is typically caused by an infection with microorganisms. Most infections are due to viruses with bacteria, fungi, and protozoa being the next most common causes.
 
Broadly, there are five types of meningitis :<br>
1.Bacterial meningitis, which is caused by bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae and spread through close contact. It can be life threatening, so immediate medical attention is recommended.<br>
2.Viral meningitis, which is caused by viruses that can be spread through coughing, sneezing and poor hygiene.<br>
3.Parasitic meningitis, Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a very rare form of parasitic meningitis that causes a fatal brain infection.<br>  
4.Fungal meningitis, Fungal meningitis is rare and is usually carried by blood to the meninges. Although anyone can get fungal meningitis, people with weak immune system, like those suffering from AIDS, diabetes or cancer, are at a higher risk.<br>
5.Non infectious meningitis, Non–infectious meningitis does not spread from person to person but can be caused by:<br>
<ul><li>Cancers</li>
<li>Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus)</li>
<li>Certain drugs</li>
<li>Head injury</li>
<li>Brain surgery</li></ul>

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>

Diagnostic tests for meningitis include:<br>
1.Blood test – to check for the presence of bacteria or viruses that can cause meningitis<br>
2.Lumbar puncture – where a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is taken from the base of the spine and checked for the presence of bacteria or viruses<br>
3.Computerized tomography (CT) scan – if there are any other suspected problems, such as damage to the brain<br>
4.Chest X-ray to look for signs of infection<br>
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician.<br>
Possible complications include:<br>
1.Hearing loss, which may be partial or total<br>
2.Problems with memory and concentration<br>
3.Problems with co-ordination and balance<br>
4.Learning difficulties, which may be temporary or permanent<br>
5.Epilepsy / Fits<br>
6.Cerebral palsy – a general term for a set of conditions that affect movement and co-ordination<br>
7.Speech problems<br>
8.Vision loss, which may be partial or total<br>

<h2><u><i>Nipah Virus (NiV) infection</u></i></h2><a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

Nipah virus (NiV) infection is a new emerging zoonotic disease (transmissible from animals to humans) affecting both animals (pigs and other domestic animals) and humans. Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus are the natural host for the virus.
NiV was first identified in Malaysia in 1998, during an outbreak of disease that occurred in a place called Kampung Sungai Nipah. Pigs were the intermediate hosts in this outbreak and most of the human cases resulted from exposure to ill pigs. After that in Singapore during March 1999 eleven abattoir workers developed NiV infection following close contact with imported pigs from Malaysia.  
Outbreak of Nipah virus infection was reported in Bangladesh in 2001. Since then, outbreaks of Nipah virus encephalitis have been reported almost every year in selected districts of Bangladesh. Consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by flying bats was the primary source of human NiV infection in Bangladesh.
In India outbreaks of NiV infection were reported from Siliguri (January-February 2001) and Nadia (April-2007) districts in West Bengal. Seventy one cases with 50 deaths (70% of the cases) occurred in two outbreaks. Recently in May 2018 an outbreak of NiV infection is reported from Kerala.  
Outbreaks reported from South-East Asia have a seasonal pattern with occurrence during winter and spring (December-May). This pattern could be associated with several factors like the breeding season of the bats, increased shedding of virus by the bats and the date palm sap harvesting season. Nipah cases may occur in a cluster or as an outbreak.
There is strong evidence that loss of natural habitats of bats by human activity may attribute to emergence of bat-related viral infection communicable to humans and animals. 
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
Symptoms of disease may appear with in 5 to 14 days (incubation period) after an exposure to infection:<br>  
1.Clinical presentations of NiV infection in humans varies from asymptomatic infection to fever, headache for 3-14 days followed by drowsiness, respiratory illness, disorientation and mental confusion.<br>
2.In severe cases these signs and symptoms can progress to coma within 24-48 hours.<br>
3.The case fatality rate ranges from 9 to 75%.<br>
4.Those who may have recovered from an acute episode may also have a relapse.<br>
5.Long-term sequelae following Nipah virus infection have been noted in the form of persistent convulsions and personality changes.<br>
6.Latent infections with subsequent reactivation of Nipah virus and death have also been reported months and even years after exposure<br>


<h3>Causes</h3>

Nipah virus (NiV) infection is caused by a virus, that is named after the Malaysian village where it was first discovered. NiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus.
<br>Mode of transmission-
Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus have been identified as natural reservoirs of NiV. Bats are symptomless carriers of NiV, but infected bats shed virus in their excretion and secretion such as saliva, urine, semen and excreta. The NiV is highly contagious among pigs and spreads by coughing.
<br>Transmission of disease can occur-<br>
1.After direct contact with infected bats, infected pigs.<br>
2.Human to human transmission by direct contact from other NiV infected people.<br>
3.By consumption of raw date palm sap and fruits contaminated with infectious bat excretions.<br>
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>

Laboratory confirmation of NiV Infection in a suspected case of NiV can be done during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease by using a combination of tests.<br> 
1.Virus isolation attempts and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from throat and nasal swabs, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and blood can be performed in the early stages of disease.<br>
2.Antibody detection by ELISA (IgG and IgM) can be used in later stages.<br>
3.In fatal cases (after death), immunohistochemistry on tissues collected during autopsy may be the only way to confirm a diagnosis<br>
<br>Preventions
Nipah virus infection can be prevented by-<br>
1.Avoiding exposure to sick pigs and bats in endemic areas.<br>
2.Not drinking raw date palm sap.<br>
3.Early detection of disease in communities and livestock, and raising awareness of transmission and symptoms of disease.<br>
4.Reinforcing standard infection control practices to avoid human-to-human infections in hospital settings (nosocomial infection) - Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed NiV should implement Standard Precautions
when caring for patients and handling specimens from them.

<h2><u><i>Plague</u></i></h2><a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

Plague is a communicable disease, caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is one of the oldest diseases known to man and still occurs in the tropics, subtropics and warmer areas of temperate countries. Past outbreaks have shown that plague may reoccur in areas that have long remained silent.
Plague is primarily a zoonotic disease (transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans)
of wild rodents and man is affected incidentally. It is transmitted from one rodent to another by fleas (ectoparasites) and from animals to humans either by the bite of infected fleas, or direct contact, inhalation and rarely, ingestion of infective materials when handling infected hosts.
Widespread pandemics (disease occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population) of plague have occurred in past with high mortality. It was known as the "Black Death" during the fourteenth century, causing an estimated 50 million deaths. Nearly half of deaths were in Asia and Africa and the other half were in Europe.
Plague is endemic (a disease that occurs regularly in a particular area) in many countries in Africa, former Soviet Union, Americas and Asia. The distribution of plague coincides with the geographical distribution of the rodents it infects, which are found in all continents except Australia.
Plague epidemics (unusually high occurrence of a disease in a population or area) have occurred in Africa, Asia, and South America but since the 1990s, most human cases have occurred in Africa. In 2013 there were 783 cases reported worldwide, including 126 deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 20 countries in Africa, America, and Asia are identified as natural foci for plague. The 3 most endemic countries are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru. In Madagascar, outbreaks have occurred nearly every year since 1980.
In India, outbreaks of plague occurred in Mamla village of district Beed, Maharashtra state (bubonic type) and district Surat in Gujarat state (pneumonic type) in September 1994. Subsequently, suspected cases of pneumonic plague were reported from Delhi, Varanasi, Karnataka and other states. A total of 876 cases and 54 deaths were reported. In 2002, outbreak of pneumonic plague occurred in Himachal Pradesh with 16 cases and 4 deaths. In 2004, outbreak of bubonic plague was reported from Dangud village, of district Uttar Kashi, Uttarakhand state with 8 cases & 3 deaths.  
The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi has identified four sylvatic foci (affecting wild animals) in India; the tri-junction of south India (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu), Beed belt in Maharashtra, Rohru in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. NCDC is keeping routine surveillance in these areas.
Weak health systems and low standards of environmental hygiene are risk factors for outbreaks of human plague. As with many primarily zoonotic diseases, plague is a very severe disease in people, with case fatality rates of 50-60% if left untreated.

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
Incubation period (time taken between catching an infection and appearance of symptoms) of the disease is 3-7 days. Disease starts with flu like symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea.
Depending on the route of infection, there are three forms of plague: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.<br>
<br>1.Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea usually on the lower extremities. Plague bacillus (Y. pestis), enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it proliferates. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, swollen and is called a "bubo". The most usual place for this swelling is the groin, but it also occurs in the armpits and the neck. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. Bubonic plague cannot spread from person to person.
<br>2.Septicaemic plague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without forming a “bubo". Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Advanced stages of the bubonic form of plague will also lead to direct spread of Y. pestis in the blood.
<br>3.Pneumonic plague-or lung-based plague- It is less common form of plague and is caused by spread of infection to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. It is highly infectious and can spread from human to human via infected air droplets or through infected clothing and other contaminated articles. Untreated pneumonic plague has a very high case-fatality ratio.


<h3>Causes</h3>

Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis (non-motile, non-acid fast, non spore forming, gram-negative cocco-bacillus). Y. pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight, high temperatures, and disinfectants.     
<br>Vectors of plague- Fleas are the natural vectors of plague in the world. In India, the important fleas for plague transmission are Xenopsylla cheopis, X. astia and X. brasiliensis. Out of these X. cheopis is the principal vector.
<br>Reservoir of infection – Wild rodents are the natural hosts of Y. pestis. At least 220 species of rodents which inhabit mountains, plains, deserts, cultivated fields and forests in both temperate and tropical climate are known to be infected with plague bacillus. Tatera indica among the wild rodents and Rattus norvegicus and R.rattus among the commensal rodents play an important role as reservoir of Y. pestis. In India Tatera indica acts as a main reservoir of infection, not the domestic rat (R.rattus).Generally the infection is maintained by the resistant species of the wild rodents. The susceptible rodents die due to the disease.  
<h3>Mode of transmission</h3>
1.Flea bites-Plague bacteria are mostly transmitted by bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics (occurrence of disease at higher rates than expected, in animal population), many rodents die, and causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primary bubonic or septicaemic plague.
Contact with contaminated fluid or tissue- Humans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague-infected animal without using proper precautions such as hunters. This type of transmission results in bubonic plague or septicaemic plague.
<br>2.Infectious droplets- Infected droplets from a case of pneumonic plaque can infect other person. Contact with infected cats can transmit the infection to humans by droplet infection.  

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>

When plague is suspected, clinical specimens should be collected immediately and specific antimicrobial treatment should be started before confirmation of laboratory diagnosis. Routine diagnostic specimens for smear and culture include the following: whole blood; aspirates from suspected buboes; pharyngeal swabs, sputum samples or tracheal washes (from those with suspected plague pharyngitis or pneumonia); and cerebrospinal fluid (from those with suspected meningitis).
Smear examination-During epidemics or epizootics, the examinations of smears (stained with Wayson's stain) that show the presence of characteristic bipolar stained plague bacilli are helpful in preliminary diagnosis.
Fluorescent antibody (FA) staining- the smears should be stained with the fluorescent-antibody test (FA).
Culture-Samples collected for culture can be transported to laboratory in Cary-Blair transport medium then cultured on other biological media. Presence of bacilli can be confirmed by Bacteriophage Lysis Test.
Serology- Presence of a single high titre of plague antibody in individual who has not been vaccinated earlier gives a presumptive diagnosis of plague. Whereas a fourfold rise in antibody in two serum samples collected at least 10 days apart gives the confirmation of plague diagnosis.  
Other tests- Polymerase Chain Reaction for the detection of selected Yesinia pestis genes, ELISA based rapid serological tests, animal inoculation.
Laboratory diagnostic categories for human plague are as follows:
Case definitions:<br>
Suspect plague:<br>  
<ul><li>Compatible clinical and epidemiological features</li>
<li>Suspicious organisms seen or isolated from clinical specimens</li></ul>
Presumptive plague:<br>
<ul><li>Y. pestis F1 antigen detected in clinical materials by direct fluorescent antibody testing, or by some other standardized antigen detection method; or</li>
<li>isolate from a clinical specimen demonstrates biochemical reactions consistent with Y. pestis or Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) positivity; or</li>
<li>a single serum specimen is found positive for diagnostic levels of antibodies to Y. pestis F1 antigen, not explainable on the basis of prior infection or immunization.</li></ul>
Confirmed plague:<br>
<ul><li>isolate identified as Y. pestis by phage lysis of cultures; or</li>
<li>a significant (a 4-fold or greater) change in antibody titre to the F1 antigen in paired serum specimens</li></ul>
Post-mortem specimens, specimens from rodent tissues, flea specimens, and soil specimens are also used to determine the eco-epidemiology of the infection.

<h3>Preventions</h3>
Prevention and control of human plague transmission-
Prevention and control of human plague transmission is a multidisciplinary approach. Preventive measures include regular surveillance for the zoonotic plague and informing local people if zoonotic plague is occurring in their surroundings.
In India, Plague laboratory at Zoonosis Division of NCDC, Delhi and Plague Surveillance Unit, at its Bengaluru Branch, Karnataka are involved with various activities in control measures and bacteriological and serological surveillance in rodents and rat fleas. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), Government of India is managing surveillance activities in humans through its impending outbreak reporting and weekly surveillance reporting systems.
The information should be provided to local people regarding -<br>
1.precautions to be taken against the flea bites,<br>
2.not to handle animal carcasses in plague-endemic areas,<br>
3.avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as suppurating buboes,<br>
4.avoid exposure to patients with pneumonic plague,<br>
5.various socio-epidemiological factors responsible for an outbreak in that particular area.<br>
Local physicians and other health care workers must be familiar with the symptoms of plague and consider it in the differential diagnosis.
If plague is suspected, samples should be collected for lab confirmation. Treatment must be started without waiting for confirmation of diagnosis.
Active surveillance should be started for identification of other cases exist or have occurred recently in the same vicinity. Prompt reporting is important for cases of pneumonic plague because this form of the disease can be transmitted directly from person to person via infectious aerosols.<br>
Notification: under the International Health Regulations, WHO Member States have to notify plague when it occurs in humans in their territories.<br>
Control of flea: destruction of rat fleas by proper application of an effective insecticide is most effective method to break the chain of transmission of disease.<br>
Control of rodents: Long term measures to control rodents should be based on improvement of sanitation in human dwellings and their vicinity.<br>
Chemoprophylaxis: Post exposure prophylactic therapy with antibiotics may be given to following persons if the exposure was in the previous six days:<br>
1.close contact with pneumonic plague patients,<br>
2.persons likely to have been exposed to Y. pestis-infected fleas,<br>  
3.had direct contact with body fluids or tissues of a Y. pestis-infected mammal,<br>  
4.exposed during a laboratory accident to known infectious materials.<br>
Vaccination- A plaque vaccine is available for human use, though it is not recommended for the public at large or for those with only casual potential exposures. The vaccine is therefore indicated for persons whose work routinely brings them into close contact with Y. pestis, such as laboratory technicians in plague reference and research laboratories and persons studying infected rodent colonies.

<h2><u><i>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)</u></i></h2><a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

It is a viral respiratory disease in humans which is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It is a severe, life threatening form of pneumonia. SARS originated in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002. The infection quickly spread to other countries (a pandemic), and resulted in more than 8,000 cases and 774 deaths before the virus was eventually brought under control.

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

SARS has flu-like symptoms that usually begins after incubation period of 2-10 days. They include:<br>
1.High temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above<br>
2.Fatigue (extreme tiredness)<br>
3.Headache<br>
4.Chills<br>
5.Muscle pain<br>
6.Loss of appetite<br>
7.Diarrhea<br>

<h3>Causes</h3>

Coronaviruses are positive-strand, enveloped RNA viruses that are important pathogens of mammals and birds. This group of viruses cause enteric or respiratory tract infections in a variety of animals, including humans, livestock, and pets.

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): It can detect genetic material of the SARS-CoV in various specimens like blood, stool, respiratory secretions or body tissues Sampling for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) diagnostic tests.
ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay): A test detecting a mixture of IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum of SARS patients yields positive results reliably at around day 21 after the onset of illness.
IFA (Immunofluorescence Assay): A test detecting IgM antibodies in serum of SARS patients yields positive results after about day 10 of illness. This test format is also used to test for IgG. This is a reliable test requiring the use of fixed SARS virus on an immunofluorescence microscope. Positive antibody test results indicate a previous infection with SARS-CoV. Seroconversion from negative to positive or a four-fold rise in antibody titre from acute to convalescent serum indicates recent infection.
Negative antibody test results: No detection of antibody after 21 days from onset of illness seems to indicate that no infection with SARS-CoV took place.
<h3>Prevention</h3>
To avoid spreading the infection, it is important to follow the prevention advice outlined below:<br>
1.Wash your hands thoroughly using an alcohol-based hand detergent.<br>
2.	Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze orcough<br>
3.Avoid sharing food, drink and utensils.<br>
4.Regularly clean surfaces with disinfectant.<br>

<h2><u><i>Swine Flu</u></i></h2><a href="#top">Go back to top</a>


Swine flu also known as swine influenza or Pandemic Influenza is a respiratory disease. It is caused by virus called H1N1 virus (introduced in 2009). This virus infects the wind pipe (respiratory tract) of pigs and later it gets transmitted to human beings. It results in nasal secretions, cough, decreased appetite, and restless behavior.
Swine flu was a relatively new strain of influenza virus (flu) that was responsible for a flu pandemic during 2009-2010. Swine flu viruses may mutate (change) so that they are easily transmissible among humans. 
On 10 August 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the swine flu pandemic was officially over. However, this does not mean that swine flu has been completely eliminated. The H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic is now a regular flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally worldwide.
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
Swine flu has an incubation period (the time taken for the symptoms to appear) of 1-4 days. Its symptoms are similar to influenza (flu). These include:<br>
1.Fever<br> 
2.Headache<br>
3.Running nose<br>
4.Sore throat<br>
5.Shortness of breath or cough<br>
6.Loss of appetite<br> 
7.Diarrhea or vomiting<br>

<h3>Causes</h3>
Swine flu is caused by virus called H1N1 virus. This virus infects the wind pipe (respiratory tract) of pigs and later it gets transmitted to human beings. It results in nasal secretions, cough, decreased appetite, and restless behavior.
Swine flu can spread to others up to about 6 feet away. The flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouth or nose of people who are nearby, which can be possibly inhaled into the lungs. In some cases, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it.
Diagnosis
Swine flu can be diagnosed clinically by the patient's history and their symptoms. The diagnosis may further confirmed in the laboratory through a technique called RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction).

<h3>Prevention</h3>
The most effective way to prevent the spread of infections is to practice good hygiene. Vaccination against influenza also has some role.
 
Tips for Prevention :<br>

1.	Frequent hand-washing.<br>
2.	"Hands-off-the-face" approach. Resist all temptations to touch any part of face.<br>
3.	Gargle twice a day with warm salt water. (H1N1 takes 2-3 days after initial infection in the throat / nasal cavity to proliferate and show characteristic symptoms).<br>
4.	Clean your nostrils at least once every day with warm salt water. Blowing the nose hard once a day and swabbing both nostrils with cotton buds dipped in warm salt water is very effective in bringing down viral population.<br>
5.	Boost your natural immunity with foods that are rich in Vitamin C (Amla and other citrus fruits).<br>
6.	Drink as much of warm liquids (tea, coffee, etc) as you can. Drinking warm liquids has the same effect as gargling, but in the reverse direction. They wash off proliferating viruses from the throat into the stomach where they cannot survive, proliferate or do any harm.<br>

<h2><u><i>Urban Yellow Fever</u></i></h2><a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

Yellow fever is a serious viral infection that is   spread by a   mosquito known as the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The causative agent is virus   of the Flavivirus genus. Yellow fever mainly occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (countries to the south of the Sahara desert), South America and in parts of the Caribbean.
There are two forms of yellow fever: Urban and Jungle. Clinically and etiologically they are identical.
Urban yellow fever is an epidemic viral disease of humans transmitted from infected to susceptible persons by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which breed in domestic and peri domestic containers (e.g., water jars, barrels, drums, tires, or tin cans) and thus in close association with humans. In areas where Ae. aegypti has been eliminated or suppressed, urban yellow fever has disappeared. Urban yellow fever can be prevented by vaccinating human populations at risk for infection or by suppressing populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes so that they no longer perpetuate infection.
Jungle yellow fever can most effectively be prevented by vaccination of human populations at risk for exposure.
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
Incubation period of yellow fever is   3-6 days. Symptoms occur in 2 stages:
The first stage is also known as the 'acute phase', include:<br>
<ul><li>A high temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above</li>
<li>Chills (shivers)</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Muscle pain, including backache</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</ul></li>
Second stage is more severe and is referred to as the 'toxic phase'. The symptoms can include:<br>
<ul><li>A recurrent fever</li>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Jaundice – a yellow tinge to the skin and whites of the eyes caused by liver damage</li>
<li>Kidney failure</li>
<li>Bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach, leading to blood in your vomit and stools (faeces)</ul></li>

<h3>Causes</h3>
Yellow fever is caused by a type of virus known as a flavivirus. The infection is transmitted by the bite of certain mosquitoes. If one is travelling, developing risks of yellow fever will depend on:<br>
1.Where you are travelling to and whether there is currently an outbreak of yellow fever in the area<br>
2.Whether you have been vaccinated for yellow fever<br>
3.Whether you are visiting jungle or forested areas<br>

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>

Yellow fever is usually diagnosed based on the symptoms and the results of a blood test.<br>
In blood tests: The blood test may also show a reduction in the number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leucopenia). This can occur because the yellow fever virus affects bone marrow (the spongy material at the centre of some bones that produces blood cells).
Laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever is generally accomplished by testing of serum to detect virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies

<h3>Prevention</h3>
Yellow fever can be prevented by taking vaccination against it. A single injection of yellow fever vaccine given subcutaneously provides immunity to 100% of its recipients. The vaccine provides immunity only after 10 days of vaccination. It confers lifelong immunity to people residing in  yellow fever endemic countries. However, booster dose is required every ten years by persons residing in non endemic countries. The vaccine is contraindicated in persons allergic to egg, hypersensitive to previous dose, pregnant females, children younger than 9 months of age or with compromised immune diseases. The vaccine can be accompanied with mild side effects like fever, soreness, redness or swelling where the shot was given. These side effects usually subside within a week.
The yellow fever vaccines are readily available at 27 government vaccination centers approved by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). The vaccination against yellow fever should be given at least 10 days before travelling to an endemic area.

<h2><u><i>Zika virus disease</u></i></h2><a href="#top">Go back to top</a>

Zika virus disease is an emerging mosquito borne viral disease. It is transmitted by bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Zika virus was first identified in Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys. In1952, it was identified in humans, in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania through serological tests. The virus was isolated from human samples in Nigeria in 1968. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.
In 2007, the South Pacific recorded its first outbreak of Zika virus in Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. In October 2013, French Polynesia reported its first outbreak.
In May 2015, the public health authorities of Brazil confirmed the transmission of Zika virus in the northeast of the country. Since October 2015, other countries and territories of the Americas have reported the presence of the virus.
Along with Zika virus infection, cluster of microcephaly (condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth) cases and other neurological disorders (Guillain-Barré Syndrome) (GBS) reported in Brazil and a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014.
World Health Organisation (WHO) strongly suspected a causal relationship between zika virus infection during pregnancy and microcephaly and recommended more investigation and research to understand any possible link. No scientific evidence to date confirms a link between Zika Virus and microcephaly or GBS.
On 1st February 2016, WHO announced that the cluster of neurological disorders and neonatal malformations reported in the Americas region constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
Since 2007, Zika viral transmission has been documented in 46 countries and territories including 34 countries which reported autochthonous transmission, or locally acquired infection, between 2015 and 2016, six countries with indication of viral circulation, five countries where the Zika virus outbreak has ended and one country with a locally acquired case but without vector borne transmission(12th February 2016)*.

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
A majority of those infected with Zika virus disease either remain asymptomatic (up to 80%) or show symptoms  similar to other arbovirus infections such as dengue, and include fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, and headache.
These symptoms are usually mild and last for 2-7 days.
The incubation period (the time from exposure to symptoms) of Zika virus disease is not clear, but is likely to be a few days.
As compared to Dengue, cases of Zika virus infection has a mild to moderate clinical picture, the onset of fever is more acute and shorter in duration.
Increased cases of Guillain-Barré syndromea (GBS) in general public and microcephalyb in newborns were reported from French Polynesia and Brazil during Zika outbreaks in 2013-2014 and 2015 respectively. Medical experts suspected an association of micocephaly and GBS with Zika virus infection. But no scientific evidence confirms a link so far*.
<br>(a. Guillain-Barré syndrome-It is a condition in which the body’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system. It can be caused by a number of viruses and can affect people of any age. The main symptoms include muscular weakness and tingling in the arms and legs. Severe complications can occur if the respiratory muscles are affected.)
<br>(b. Microcephaly- It is a condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth.)<br>
<h3>Causes</h3>
Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to dengue virus.<br>
<h3>Mode of Transmission</h3>
Vector-Zika Virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions and subtropical regions. This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.
Other species of Ades mosquito Ae. albopictus, Ae. hensilli, Ae. polynesiensis were also found as vector in spread of Zika Virus.
Some evidence suggests Zika virus can also be transmitted to humans through blood transfusion, perinatal transmission and sexual transmission.
Some facts about Ades mosquito-<br>
1.Ae. aegypti is closely associated with human environments and can breed in indoor (flower vases, concrete water tanks in bathrooms), and artificial outdoor (vehicle tyres, water storage vessels, discarded containers) environments.<br>
2.The eggs can survive up to 1 year without water. Once water is available (even small quantities of standing water), the eggs develop into larvae and then adult mosquitoes.<br>
3.Aedes mosquitoes are active during daylight hours, and usually bite during the morning and late afternoon/evening hours.<br>
4.Female Aedes mosquito acquires the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person.<bfr>
5.Female Aedes mosquito usually flies an average of 400 metres. But it may be transported accidently by humans from one place to another (e.g. in the back of the car, plants).<br>

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>

Zika virus infection should be suspected in patients reporting with acute onset of fever, maculo-papular rash and arthralgia, among those individuals who travelled to areas with ongoing transmission during the two weeks preceding the onset of illness.
Zika virus is diagnosed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation from blood samples (for research purpose). Detection of Zika virus by these methods could be done in saliva or urine samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days after symptom onset, or from serum collected in the first 1 to 3 days after onset of disease.
Serological tests, (immunofluorescence assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) may show the presence of anti-Zika virus IgM and IgG antibodies. Diagnosis by serology is difficult as the virus can cross-react with other flaviviruses such as dengue, West Nile and yellow fever.
In India, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi and National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, have the capacity to provide laboratory diagnosis of Zika virus disease in acute febrile stage. These two institutions are the apex laboratories to support the outbreak investigation and for confirmation of laboratory diagnosis. Ten additional laboratories would be strengthened by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to perform the laboratory diagnosis.
<h3>Prevention</h3>

Mosquitoes and their breeding sites pose a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control depends on reducing mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people.
Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has released National guidelines for prevention of Zika Virus disease. (www.mohfw.nic.in/ )<br>
Prevention and Control of Zika virus disease consist of-<br>
1-Enhanced surveillance-<br>
<ul><li>Community based surveillance-DGHS has recommended for enhanced surveillance at community level by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) for detection of primary case and Gullian Barre Syndrome. Maternal and Child Health division is advised to look for clustering of cases of microcephaly among new borns.</li>
<li>International Airports/ Ports-All the International Airports / Ports authorities are advised to keep watch on passengers returning from affected countries and suffering from febrile illness and to follow the recommended aircraft disinfection guidelines.</li>
<li>Activation of Rapid Response Teams (RRTs)-RRTs have been advised to be activated at all levels, for investigation of suspected outbreaks. NCDC, Delhi is assigned as nodal agency for investigation of outbreak in any part of the country.</li>
<li>Laboratory Diagnosis -NCDC, Delhi and NIV, Pune are the apex laboratories to support the outbreak investigation and for confirmation of laboratory diagnosis. ICMR would strengthen ten additional laboratories in the country.</li></ul>
<br>2. Risk communication-The States/ Union territories administrations have to create increased awareness among clinicians including obstetricians, paediatricians and neurologists about Zika virus disease and its possible link with adverse pregnancy outcome (foetal loss, microcephaly). Non-governmental organisation should also be sensitised about Zika virus disease.
<br>3. Vector control- Mosquito control is the only measure that can interrupt the transmission of vector borne viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. This can be achieved by enhanced integrated vector management (IVM).
IVM includes-<br>
<ul><li>Vector surveillance- larval surveys and adult surveys, are important for early detection of Ades mosquito population so that proper control measures could be initiated.
<li>Vector management- It includes methods to eliminate mosquito breeding and adult mosquito population. These are –
<ul><li>Environment management methods are used to control immature stages of Ades mosquitoes. Intensify efforts to reduce actual or potential larval habitats in and around houses by:
<ul><li>Covering all water containers in the house to prevent fresh egg laying by the vector.</li>
<li>Emptying, drying water tanks, containers, coolers, bird baths, pets’ water bowls, plant pots, drip trays at least once each week.</li>
<li>Regularly checking for clogged gutters and flat roofs that may have poor drainage.</li></li></ul>
<li>Biological control-
<ul><li>Introducing larvivorous fishes (e.g., Gambusia / Guppy) in ornamental water tanks/garden.</li>
<li>Using endotoxin producing bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt H-14) as biological larvicide in stagnant water, poses no danger to humans, non-targeted animal species, or the environment when used according to directions.</li></li></ul>
<li>Chemical control-
<ul><li>Chemical larvicides are recommended in permanent big water containers where water has to be conserved or stored because of scarcity of water or irregular and unreliable water supply. Temephos (organophate compound) is recommended as a larvicide under public health programme.</li>
<li>Adulticide- In areas where autochthonous or imported cases of dengue, chikungunya, and/or Zika virus (as the vector is same) are detected, Pyrethrum spray or Malathion fogging or ultra low volume (ULV) spray are recommended for the control of adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.</li></li></li></ul>
<li>Personal protective/prevention measures-
<ul><li>This can be done by using insect repellent; wearing clothes (preferably light-coloured) that cover as much of the body as possible; using physical barriers such as screens, closed doors and windows; and sleeping under mosquito nets.</li>
<li>Since the Aedes mosquitoes are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should use insecticide-treated mosquito nets to provide protection.</li>
<li>In areas where Zika virus is transmitting patients (infected with dengue, chikungunya, or Zika virus), their household members, and the community, must follow personal preventive measures.</li></li></ul>
<li>Legislative Measures- Suitable laws and byelaws should be enacted and implemented for avoidance of situations which favour mosquito breeding at various levels.</li>
 
<li>Health education for community mobilisation and inter-sectoral convergence- Community participation to eliminate the breeding points of Ades mosquitoes with the involvement of other sectors/departments should be encouraged.</li></ul></ul>
<br>4. Travel advisory-
<ul><li>All travellers to the affected countries/ areas should strictly follow individual protective measures, especially during day time, to prevent mosquito bites (use of mosquito repellent cream, electronic mosquito repellents, use of bed nets, and dress that appropriately covers most of the body parts).</li>
<li>Non-essential travel to the affected countries to be deferred/ cancelled.</li>
<li>Pregnant women or women who are trying to become pregnant should defer/ cancel their travel to the affected areas.</li>
<li>Travellers having febrile illness within two weeks of return from an affected country should report to the nearest health facility.</li>
<li>Pregnant women who have travelled to areas with Zika virus transmission should consult medical expert.</li></ul>
Precautionary measures for pregnant women and women considering pregnancy recommended by WHO-<br>
<ul><li>Women who are pregnant should discuss their travel plans with their health care provider and consider delaying travel to any area where locally acquired infection is occurring.</li>
<li>Until more is known about the risk of sexual transmission, all men and women returning from an area where zika is circulating especially pregnant women and their parterres should practice safe sex including through the correct and consistent use of condoms.</li>
<li>All travellers, including pregnant women, going to an area where locally acquired Zika virus infection is occurring should adhere closely to steps that can prevent mosquito bites during the trip.</li></ul>
(WHO is not recommending any travel or trade restrictions at this level.)
<br>5. Coordination with international agencies-NCDC, Delhi is a focal point for International Health Regulations (IHR) is authorised to seek/ share information with the affected countries and with World Health Organization for updates on the evolving epidemic.
<br>6. Research- In India, ICMR is advised to conduct research.
Vaccine – Currently there is no vaccine available for prevention of Zika virus disease. According to WHO around 15 pharmaceutical companies have commenced work in this direction. A DNA vaccine from the US National Institutes of Health and an inactivated product from Bharat Biotech in India are at advanced stage. Further vaccines will take at least 18 months for any large-scale trials*.
<br>7. Monitoring-Joint Monitoring group under DGHS is monitoring the situation on regular basis.
